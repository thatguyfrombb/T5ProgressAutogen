# T5ProgressAutogen
 Autogenerates a progress.txt style file for Trxyebeep/TOMB5. Also, some basic reports.
 
 *IMPORTANT: NEVER REPLACE THE ORIGINAL PROGRESS.TXT FILE WITH AN AUTOGEN ONE. THIS COULD BE BUGGY, IT COÃœLD DELETE STUFF. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.*

 Files from T5Autogen are meant to complement the original progress.txt, to help devs update it and see how the project progresses.

# TODO
 - Consistency checks
 - Option to update from previous fileAutoPD
 - Maybe more automation?
